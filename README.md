#misc
I am using this repo to store miscellaneous items I want version-controlled.
Most of these will most likely be little Python script that I use in my
research often. Feel free to use them if you like, I am mainly using this
to keep my stuff backed-up and in one central location - I've re-written many
of these scripts many times because I'm usually too lazy to dig through my
directories to find them.

##cdf.py/.cpp (located in /research/)
Python script to get the CDF of a dataset and report relevant data.
Wrote the C++ version just now to make it super fast!
